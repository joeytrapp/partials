## Methods

### PartialHelper::render(string $name, array $data, array $options)

Renders an element relative to the View::viewPath instead of View/Elements. Assumes the element file begins with an underscore.

	<?php echo $this->Partial->render("form"); ?>

Will look for \_form.ctp in the View::viewPath (for /posts/add it would be View/Posts/\_form.ctp).

The $data and $options params are passed on to View::element() method. An additional option is "collection". If "collection" is an array, then the View::element() will be called for each iteration of the "collection" array. The value of the current iteration is merged in the data array under the element name (without the underscore) key.
